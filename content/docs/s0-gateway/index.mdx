# S0 IoT Gateway

The **S0 IoT Gateway** is a **Zephyr-based IoT gateway** combining the **S0 Board** with the **Baseboard**. Built around the ESP32-C6 RISC-V microcontroller running Zephyr RTOS, S0 delivers multi-protocol wireless connectivity for smart metering, industrial IoT, and edge computing applications.

> **S0 = S0 Board + Baseboard — Zephyr RTOS**

> Looking for a Linux-based gateway? See the [S1 Gateway](/docs/s1-gateway), which combines the S0 Board with BeagleV-Fire.

## Overview

S0 collects data from multiple wireless protocols and transmits it securely to the cloud. It integrates with [Magistrala](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala), a modern, scalable, open-source IoT platform.

### Key Problem Statement

IoT deployments face several critical challenges:

- Fragmented infrastructure requiring multiple gateways for different protocols
- High power consumption unsuitable for battery-powered installations
- Closed proprietary platforms limiting flexibility
- Lack of secure, flexible edge compute capabilities
- Complex cloud integration increasing operational costs

S0 addresses these challenges with a unified, open-source platform.
