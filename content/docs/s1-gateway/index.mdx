# S1 Gateway

The S1 Gateway is a **Linux-based IoT gateway** that combines the S0 Board with the [BeagleV-Fire](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglev-fire) to deliver advanced edge computing and multi-protocol wireless connectivity in a single platform.

## What is S1?

S1 = **S0 Board** + **BeagleV-Fire**

Unlike the S0 Gateway (which runs Zephyr RTOS), S1 runs a full **Linux operating system** on RISC-V architecture. This makes S1 the right choice when your application requires:

- A full Linux environment (Ubuntu, Debian, Yocto, etc.)
- Containerised workloads (Docker, Podman)
- Edge AI and ML inference (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX)
- Advanced networking and protocol translation
- Richer software ecosystems and third-party tooling

The S0 module within S1 provides all the multi-protocol wireless capabilities — Wireless M-Bus (868 MHz), NB-IoT, LTE-M, WiFi, and BLE — while the BeagleV-Fire handles Linux compute and cloud connectivity.

## What You'll Need

### Hardware

- S0 IoT Gateway module
- BeagleV-Fire board
- USB-C cable for power and programming
- Optional: Ethernet cable (via BeagleV-Fire's onboard GbE port)

### Software

- Linux host machine for flashing and development
- Serial terminal (minicom, screen, or PuTTY)
- Git
- Docker or Podman (optional, for containerised workloads)

### Accounts

- [Magistrala](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala) instance (cloud or local)
- Optional: NB-IoT/LTE-M SIM card with data plan
- Optional: OCI registry for container or Wasm modules

## Quick Start

1. Connect the S0 module to the BeagleV-Fire board.
2. Power the S1 gateway via USB-C on the BeagleV-Fire board.
3. Connect to the BeagleV-Fire's serial console to access the Linux shell.
4. Configure wireless interfaces (WiFi, LTE-M, or NB-IoT) as needed.
5. Install and configure the Magistrala agent to connect to your IoT platform.

For detailed setup instructions, hardware pin-outs, and integration guides, refer to the [S0 Gateway docs](/docs/s0-gateway) for the wireless module and the [BeagleV-Fire documentation](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglev-fire) for the Linux board.
