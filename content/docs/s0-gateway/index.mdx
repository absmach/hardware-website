# S0 IoT Gateway

The **S0 IoT Gateway** is a robust and modular IoT gateway designed for smart metering, industrial IoT, and edge computing applications. Built around the ESP32-C6 microcontroller with RISC-V core, S0 delivers multi-protocol connectivity with professional-grade reliability.

## Overview

S0 is capable of collecting data from multiple wireless protocols and transmitting it securely to the cloud via various connectivity options. It integrates with [Magistrala](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala), a modern, scalable, secure, open-source IoT platform.

### Key Problem Statement

IoT deployments face several critical challenges:

- Fragmented infrastructure requiring multiple gateways for different protocols
- High power consumption unsuitable for battery-powered installations
- Closed proprietary platforms limiting flexibility
- Lack of secure, flexible edge compute capabilities
- Complex cloud integration increasing operational costs

S0 addresses these challenges with a unified, open-source platform.
