# Connecting S0 to Magistrala via WebSockets

## Running Magistrala

Ensure that Magistrala is running.

Ensure also you are in the `embedded/targets/zephyr/websocket` directory when executing the below steps.

Modify the configuration file in `src/config.h`.

Start with the WiFi credentials, as S0 in this case is in Station Mode:

```c
#define WIFI_SSID "SSID"    // Replace `SSID` with WiFi ssid
#define WIFI_PSK "PASSWORD" // Replace `PASSWORD` with Router password
```

## Configuring Magistrala Variables

```c
#define MAGISTRALA_HOSTNAME "messaging.magistrala.absmach.eu" // Replace with your Magistrala instance hostname or IP
#define MAGISTRALA_WS_PORT 8186
#define DOMAIN_ID "DOMAIN_ID"         // Replace with your Domain ID
#define CLIENT_ID "CLIENT_ID"         // Replace with your Client ID
#define CLIENT_SECRET "CLIENT_SECRET" // Replace with your Client secret
#define CHANNEL_ID "CHANNEL_ID"       // Replace with your Channel ID
```

## Building and Flashing Code

Once you update the configuration file, build and run the code:

```bash
west build -p always -b esp32c6_devkitc
west flash
west espressif monitor
```
