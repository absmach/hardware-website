# S0 IoT Gateway

![S0 IoT Gateway](../images/s0.png)

The **S0 IoT Gateway** is a robust and modular IoT Gateway for smart metering applications. Built around the **ESP32-C6** microcontroller with a RISC-V core, it runs **Zephyr RTOS** and supports both **Wireless M-Bus (wMBus)** and **wired M-Bus** utility meters, transmitting collected data securely to [Magistrala](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala).

> **S0 = S0 Board + Baseboard — Zephyr RTOS**

> Looking for a Linux-based gateway? See the [S1 Gateway](/docs/s1-gateway), which combines the S0 Board with BeagleV-Fire.

## Overview

S0 collects data from multiple wireless protocols and transmits it securely to the cloud. It integrates with [Magistrala](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala), a modern, scalable, open-source IoT platform.

## Hardware Architecture

### Core Components

| Component         | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ESP32-C6          | Main microcontroller (RISC-V, WiFi, BLE)      |
| RC-S2LP           | Wireless M-Bus 868 MHz transceiver            |
| SIM7080G          | NB-IoT/LTE-M module                           |
| Ethernet          | (Optional) local network through S0 Baseboard |
| USB-C & Terminals | For power and debug                           |
| GNSS Support      | Optional via SIM7080G for asset tracking      |

The board is compact and optimized for IP-rated DIN-rail enclosures for industrial/outdoor environments. It features side-mounted IPEX connectors for each antenna (WiFi, GNSS, NB-IoT, wMBus).

### Connectivity Options

- **Receive Data**: WiFi, BLE, M-Bus, wM-Bus, I2C, SPI, UART
- **Transmit Data**: NB-IoT, LTE-M, WiFi, Ethernet (via Base Board), 4G/5G

### Power Management

The S0 board can be powered in 3 ways:

- **USB-C**: For development and testing
- **Power JST**: Battery of maximum 7.4V connected via the battery JST connector
- **Baseboard**: The Baseboard supplies both 5V and 3.3V to the S0 board

## Wireless Communication

- **WiFi/BLE**: The ESP32-C6 provides 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and BLE. An IPEX connector on the ESP32-C6 accepts a 2.4GHz antenna of your choice.

- **Wireless M-Bus**: The RC-S2LP module enables wireless M-Bus communication with wMBus meters at 868 MHz. An IPEX connector accepts a 868 MHz antenna.

- **NB-IoT / LTE-M**: The SIM7080G module provides NB-IoT/LTE-M connectivity. Two IPEX connectors handle RF (wireless) and GNSS (GPS) antennas. The SIM7080G is controlled via AT commands from the ESP32.

## Firmware and Flashing

The S0 board uses the ESP32-C6 as its main microcontroller and can be programmed using any framework of your choice. Firmware is flashed through the USB-C connector.

Debug is possible via the USB-C connector or the JTAG pins labelled on the board, enabling both on-site and off-site debugging.

## Software Stack
