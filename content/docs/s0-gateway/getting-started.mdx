# Getting Started with S0

This guide will help you get up and running with the S0 IoT Gateway.

## What You'll Need

### Hardware

- S0 IoT Gateway module
- USB-C cable for power and programming
- Optional: S0 Base Board for expanded functionality

### Software

- [Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)
- Serial terminal (minicom, screen, or PuTTY)
- Git

### Accounts

- [Magistrala](https://cloud.magistrala.absmach.eu) account (cloud or local instance)
- Optional: NB-IoT/LTE-M SIM card with data plan

## Development Environment Setup

### Install Zephyr OS

To program and build firmware for the S0 board, install **Zephyr OS** from the official website:

[https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

Zephyr provides:

- Hardware abstraction for ESP32-C6 peripherals
- Real-time task scheduling
- Networking and protocol stacks
- Secure communication and TLS support

Once Zephyr is installed, you can build and flash applications directly to the S0 board using `west`.

### Clone the Embedded Repository

Zephyr code for the various protocols can be accessed by cloning the [Embedded Repository](https://github.com/absmach/embedded):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/embedded
```

## Magistrala Setup

1. Navigate to [Magistrala](https://cloud.magistrala.absmach.eu) and sign up.

2. Create a domain, channel, and client.

3. Connect the client to the channel you created.

4. Note down the `CHANNELID`, `DOMAINID`, `CLIENTID`, and `CLIENTSECRET` — you will need these when configuring firmware.

## Uploading Code

Before uploading any code, be sure to have activated a virtual environment as guided in the [Zephyr documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html).

Download and install the binary blobs that the Espressif HAL needs:

```bash
west blob fetch hal_espressif
```

Navigate to the Zephyr protocol examples:

```bash
cd embedded/targets/zephyr
ls
```

Choose the protocol you want to communicate over by moving into that directory. Make sure the directory contains:

```
CMakeLists.txt
prj.conf
src/
```

Change the variables in `src/config.h` to match your SuperMQ environment:

- `CLIENTID`
- `CLIENTSECRET`
- `DOMAINID`
- `CHANNELID`

Build the code:

```bash
west build -p always -b esp32c6_devkitc
```

The board parameter can be changed to whichever board you are using as long as it is recognized by Zephyr. See [Zephyr supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#) for more information.

To upload code to the S0 and monitor the serial output:

```bash
west flash
west espressif monitor
```
